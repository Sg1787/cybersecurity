##  The Threefold Path

This 24-day ritual is not mere learning—it is **devotion through destruction, refinement, and revelry**. Each challenge bends you toward one of the Great Four:

###  **Slaanesh – The Aesthetic of Precision**  
*Elegance in automation. Beauty in one-liners. The bliss of a perfectly indented Python script.*  
Beware mediocrity. Sloppy code offends the Prince of Pleasure. Your `for` loops must dance. Your regex must sing.

###  **Nurgle – The Joy of Glorious Rot**  
*Unpatched kernels. Bloated logs. Legacy systems wheezing with entropy.*  
You will inherit misconfigurations so ancient, they weep binary tears. Embrace them. Nurgle does not fear decay—he **loves** it. Patch only when the stench becomes unbearable.

###  **Khorne – The Rage of Raw Power**  
*Brute-force forensics. Terminal fury. No GUI, only `rm -rf` and `nmap -A -T5`.*  
When patience fails, let fury reign. But remember: **Khorne cares not for your scripts**—only your blood spilled in the terminal.

> *Tzeentch? He’s busy obfuscating someone else’s YAML.*

##  Structure of the Descent

Each day unlocks a new heresy—a new chance to **serve, suffer, or slay**.

Every solution will carry the mark of **at least one God**:
- **Slaanesh**: Clean, efficient, poetic.
- **Nurgle**: Functional, festering, full of `while true` loops.
- **Khorne**: Fast, destructive, no explanations.

##  Philosophy of the Damned

> *“Why secure a system when you can watch it squirm?”*  

This event is not about “good security.” It’s about **understanding systems so deeply you can corrupt them with a whisper**—or heal them with a curse.  

You’ll touch Linux shells like sacred altars.  
You’ll debug like a plaguebearer tending to sores.  
You’ll script like a consort composing symphonies in the dark.

And through it all, the **Warp watches**.
